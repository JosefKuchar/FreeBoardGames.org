Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game. This game has a 3x3 grid, and in their turn, each player places their marker (X or O) on a cell in this grid.

In order to win, a player has to complete a full horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marker. If all cells are filled and no player managed to do this, it is a draw.
