Similarly to Blokus, this game allows two to four players. In the case of only two or three players, two colors will be assigned to a single player.

Each color has 21 tiles with distinct shapes, and the objective is to cover as much of the board as possible. The first piece must be placed on the corner of the board assigned to that color.

All subsequent pieces must share a corner with at least one piece of the same color. Sharing an edge is only allowed if the pieces are not of the same color. The game ends when nobody can make a move.
